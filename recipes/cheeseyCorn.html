        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) package bacon, chopped</li>
            <li>2 (16 ounce) packages frozen sweet corn, thawed</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 bunch green onions, sliced</li>
            <li>2 jalapeno peppers, diced, or more to taste</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>2 ounces shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>4 ounces shredded Monterey Jack cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook bacon in a 10-inch cast iron skillet over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until almost crisp and fat is rendered, 7 to 8 minutes.</li>
            <li>Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.</li>
            <li>Drain frozen corn thoroughly in a colander. Add 1/2 of the corn to the skillet with the bacon. Cook and stir until kernels just start to turn
            golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Add garlic, green onions, and jalapenos; cook until vegetables start to soften and sweeten up, 3 to 4 minutes.
            Tilt pan to drain off some of the fat, using a paper towel to soak it up.</li>
            <li>Season with salt, pepper, and cayenne. Pour in cream; stir and bring to a boil. Stir in the remaining corn until heated through.
            Turn off the heat and add about 2/3 of the mozzarella and Monterey Jack cheese. Stir to combine. Top corn with remaining cheese 
            and a sprinkle of cayenne.</li>
            <li>Broil until heated through and top is browned, 5 to 10 minutes. Serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
